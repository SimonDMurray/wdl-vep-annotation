# code-challenge-wdl-vep-annotation
Nextflow Implementation of LifeBit Technical Challenge

## Testing WDL
I have not used WDL before so am trying to get something resembling the Nextflow pipeline

## Running the Pipeline
The command I am using to run the pipeline is `java -jar cromwell-85.jar run vep.wdl --inputs vep_inputs.json`
